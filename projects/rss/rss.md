---

## Course Description

*Robotics: Science and Systems* was an intensive and practical exploration into the realm of robotics, was structured to impart a comprehensive understanding of autonomous systems design and implementation. It began with foundational principles in robotics, covering aspects such as sensor integration, control systems, and basic algorithmic approaches. As the course progressed, students delved deeper into more complex topics like real-time localization, path planning algorithms, and the integration of various sensory data. This hands-on course emphasized not only theoretical knowledge but also practical application, culminating in the creation of an autonomous racing robot. The project served as a platform for students to apply their learned skills in a challenging, real-world scenario, encouraging innovation, problem-solving, and technical proficiency in robotics. Through a series of incremental labs and assignments, students gradually built up their understanding and skills, leading to the final project that combined all elements of the course into a single, cohesive application.

## Monte Carlo Localization

In the Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) segment of our project, we focused on enhancing the autonomous race car's ability to accurately determine its position within dynamic environments. MCL, a form of probabilistic localization, was pivotal in implementing the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) process, which is essential for autonomous navigation in unknown or changing spaces.

The core of MCL involves generating a set of hypotheses (particles) about the robot's position and orientation, which are then updated as the robot moves and gathers sensory data. Our implementation utilized the onboard LiDAR sensor, which provided detailed environmental data to refine our localization estimates. This approach was particularly effective in dealing with the inherent uncertainties of real-world environments, such as dynamic obstacles and varying terrain conditions.

We iteratively refined the particle set by comparing the expected sensor readings with the actual LiDAR data, allowing us to progressively narrow down the probable location of the robot. This particle filter approach was key to achieving robust and real-time localization, enabling the robot to accurately track its position even in the presence of noise and environmental changes.

Our MCL implementation also involved optimizing various parameters such as the number of particles, resampling strategies, and motion models to balance computational efficiency with localization accuracy. The fine-tuning of these parameters was based on extensive testing in both simulated and real-world environments, ensuring that the robot could reliably determine its location under different conditions.

Moreover, the integration of MCL into our autonomous system was not just about accurate localization. It played a crucial role in the robot's decision-making processes, particularly in path planning and obstacle avoidance. By knowing its position with a high degree of certainty, the robot could make more informed choices about its movements, resulting in smoother and safer navigation.

In summary, the Monte Carlo Localization segment of our project was a testament to the effectiveness of probabilistic methods in handling the complexities of real-world autonomous navigation. It highlighted the importance of accurate localization in the broader context of robotics and served as a practical application of theoretical concepts covered in the course. This experience not only demonstrated the capabilities of MCL in a challenging environment but also provided valuable insights into the nuances of implementing such sophisticated systems in practice.

## Path Planning
A significant focus of the project was on developing efficient path-planning algorithms. Starting with the A* algorithm and progressing to more complex systems like Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRT) and RRT*, the team optimized the robot's ability to navigate through environments with obstacles. The final implementation of RRT* with its cost analysis functionality demonstrated a balance between speed and path optimality.

## Final Project
The final challenge involved two distinct tasks: track racing and an obstacle course. For track racing, the robot employed computer vision for line detection, a lookahead point for navigation, and Pure Pursuit algorithms. Monte Carlo Localization was crucial in determining the robot's precise location on the track. In the obstacle course, color segmentation and a state machine were implemented to follow a predefined path, showcasing the robot's versatility and adaptability in various scenarios.

The culmination of these components demonstrated the successful integration of various technologies and algorithms to create a fully functional autonomous racing robot. The project not only showcased technical proficiency but also highlighted the importance of iterative design and testing in robotics. Future work could explore further optimizations in path planning and adaptability to more diverse and dynamic environments.
