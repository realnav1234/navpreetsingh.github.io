Description: This dataset encapsulates the evolution of corporate ownership and owner occupancy rates within various neighborhoods of Boston from 2004 to 2024. The data is derived from property assessment records of the City of Boston. Corporate ownership is determined using keyphrase matching on the 'owner name' field, identifying corporations with markers such as “LLC”, “LLP”, “LP”, “Corp”, “Realty”, "Trust", "Bank", etc. It's important to note that this method introduces a degree of fuzziness, as not all corporate-owned properties may be captured and non-corporate entities may occasionally be misclassified. The owner occupancy rate (own_occ_rate) is calculated as the proportion of 'OWN_OCC=Y' to the total of 'OWN_OCC=Y' and 'OWN_OCC=N' within each neighborhood, excluding blanks. Similarly, the corporate ownership rate (corp_own_rate) is the proportion of 'CORP_OWN=Y' to the total of 'CORP_OWN=Y' and 'CORP_OWN=N'
